# Observer
- Define one to many relationship between objects that when one object state changes then its dependencies will be notifed and updated automatically.

# When to use
- Use it when the subject object does not know exactly how many observer objects it has.
- Or use it when the subject object should be able to notify its observer objects without knowing who these objects are.
 
# Diagram
- Stock price changes will notify the investors
