# Template Method
- Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to sub-classes. 
  The Template Method lets sub-classes redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure

# When to use
- We know the layout of a process that we can modify it later to use.
    
# Diagram
