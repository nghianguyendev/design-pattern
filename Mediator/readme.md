# Mediator
- Mediator promotes loose coupling by defining a centralized class is to be used for interaction between two different classes.
- Request-Response between the classes.
  
# Benefit
- Manage the complexity of the system by handling how they interact with each other.
  Otherwise, each of these classes will have references to the other classes in order to interact, when required. This would result in a spider web type system classes.
 
# When to use: 
- Use a mediator when the complexity of object communication begins to hinder object reusability
